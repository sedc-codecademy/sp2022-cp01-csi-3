# Crypto Simulator - 3rd Team  
# Description
Technology is always changing and evolving, and with that come new and exciting ways to implement it. An interesting trend is the blockchain and cryptocurrency market. For this reason, we created a website that simulates the values of popular cryptocurrencies and lets a user "BUY" cryptocurrencies on a certain day and see how their values fluctuate. Our site creates a simulated crypto portfolio for people that are not familiar with the concept yet or can't invest in crypto but want to experience the crypto trading world.
